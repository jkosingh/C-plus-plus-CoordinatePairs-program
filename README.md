# C-plus-plus-CoordinatePairs-program

read
in
values
from
“input.txt”
to
initialize
the
array
and
sort
the
array
of
objects
using
the
quick
sort
algorithm

Program
will
be
sorting
the
objects
in
the
array
based
on
increasing
Manhattan
Distance
between
the
coordinate
pairs.
The
Manhattan
Distance
between
two
coordinate
pairs,
(a,b)
and
(c,d),
is
defined
as
the
sum
of
the
absolute
distances
between
the
points
in
both
planes.
In
other
words,
the
Manhattan
Distance
=
|a-­‐‑c|
+
|b-­‐‑d|.
